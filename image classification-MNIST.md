The MNIST digits dataset provided by Yann Le Cun, is a well-known dataset for image classification. 
It includes images with 255 pixels 28 x 28 greyscale and labelled with a number from 0 to 9, denoting the appropriate digit. 
There are 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing datasets.  
In this project, I am going to apply one of the image classification model to have the best prediction of the image number.
